this is the actual gamepad code. My documentation sucks so ill down it now here goes. Im going to modify the code from the example
that inspired this, these modifications will primarily come in the form of me replacing the keyboard class with a gamepad class.
This abstraction will be responsable for sending messages in the joystick/gamepad forat to my amazon fire tv via gesture controlled
commands(Skywriter).
